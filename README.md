# Christmas Sales and Trends Analysis

A leading market research firm has collected detailed data on holiday sales, including customer demographics, purchase behaviors, promotional effectiveness, and satisfaction metrics. Participants are tasked with analyzing trends in shopping habits, exploring the impact of promotions, identifying key drivers of satisfaction, and revealing insights to optimize future holiday strategies.

## Questions: 
1.	How do sales volumes fluctuate during Christmas compared to other periods in the dataset?
2.	What are the age and gender distributions of customers making purchases during Christmas?
3.	Which regions or cities show the highest sales volumes during Christmas, and how do these trends compare to non-Christmas periods?
4.	What is the effect of promotions on sales during Christmas? Are specific promotions more effective than others?
5.	Which products are most popular during Christmas, and how do these preferences vary by age, gender, or location?
6.	How do customer satisfaction scores differ for Christmas purchases compared to non-Christmas transactions?
7.	What percentage of orders during Christmas include gift wrapping, and which demographics are most likely to use this service?
8.	Are express shipping options more popular during the Christmas period? How does delivery time correlate with customer satisfaction?
9.	What are the main reasons for product returns during Christmas, and do these differ from returns during other periods?
10.	How do weather (e.g., snowy, sunny) or specific Christmas events (e.g., "Christmas Market") influence sales and customer behaviour?
